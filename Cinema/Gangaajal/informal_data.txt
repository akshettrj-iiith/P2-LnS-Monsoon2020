Yadav talked very nicely with Bachcha Yadav as he was preparing him for future use. Due to this Bachcha was also very respectful.
When captured Nonua, Minister was very happy and praised Amit and talked very nicely and gave medal.
DIG was not happy, although he sounded friendly in start, he said "Bhurelaal, pata karo. Yahan kal ka chhokra hero ban gya hai."
Yadav again tried to please Amit but Amit was very disciplined. He asked them to go from police station firmly on which Yadav also left his friendly manner.
